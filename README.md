### Data for TF-IDF of Yelp Categories

You can find the TF-IDF matrix and the corresponding metadata [via this Dropbox link](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/hn4t4k9zbppm6dd/AAArh08p3n6C0YQAfsDGqVxda?dl=0).  You'll create a folder called `tfidf` at the top-level directory of this repository, and then download those files into there.
